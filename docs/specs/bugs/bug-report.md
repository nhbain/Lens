# Bug Report

The following bugs have been identified in the application:

1. Unable to save changes to source file when using the Milkdown editor.
2. When adding a single file to tracking, the file does not display in my dashboard without a refresh.
3. A single click to open the milkdown editor when interacting with the document tree feels odd. Let's change it to double click. Also, the enter key should open the milkdown editor.
4. The "warning" accent color's title and references should be changed to intermediary.
5. The default secondary color value should be changed to #6B00E5 and the default intermediary color should be changed to #D10467.
